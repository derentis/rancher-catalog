# Rancher-Catalog For Lancache

This is a catalog for Rancher 1.6 Currently we do not support Rancher 2.0

### Configuration

This will run all the necessary components to run a LanCache under Rancher 1.6, This stack now uses the monolithic caching model from steamcache/monolithic

Add this repository to your Rancher settings to take advantage of the catalog, Once you've done this you can goto Catalog -> Lancache and you can then select to install the lancache-monolithic


### More information
The LanCache stack is generated automatically from the data over at [UKLans](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains). All services that are listed in the UKLans repository are available and supported inside this stack.
